# Biography

Hi. I'm currently studying Network and Systems Engineering at FCUP. 

My Licentiate (Bachelor's), in Ciências De Engenharia Informática, is already done and only my thesis remains for my Masters, which I will be doing in the next school year of 2018-2019.

I'm interested in any kind of Software Development and Web Development; I've worked with several languages such as C, Java, Python, Haskell - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'm also familiar with basic concepts pertaining Cryptography, Compilers, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Mining.
